# 37. Gateway API as the Routing Surface with a Swappable Gateway Pack

## Context and Problem Statement

cube-idp delivers packs into a cluster and must expose the services they contain
under a single, predictable hostname. Kubernetes offers two competing routing
APIs: the legacy `Ingress` object, whose behaviour is defined largely by
controller-specific annotations, and Gateway API, whose `Gateway` and
`HTTPRoute` resources are portable across implementations. Choosing one binds
every pack author: a pack must know which kind of routing resource to emit, and
that choice cannot be renegotiated per pack without fragmenting the ecosystem.

The routing implementation itself is a separate question. ingress-nginx is
end-of-life, so a default had to be picked that would not have to be re-picked
under duress — and picking one must not make the others unreachable. Users who
run a different data plane need to swap it without maintaining a fork.

Three practical hazards follow from this. Routing must exist before anything
that needs routing, so ordering matters. The gateway's source location is read
by several commands (`up`, `diff`, `upgrade`, `doctor`), so a resolution rule
duplicated per command will drift. And a config with two fields naming the
gateway — a pack name and an OCI ref — invites an incoherent pair where the ref
points at one implementation and the name at another.

## Decision

Gateway API is the canonical routing surface for cube-idp. The gateway pack
vendors the pinned standard-channel Gateway API CRDs, and services are exposed
through Gateway API rather than Ingress. Traefik is the default gateway pack,
and swapping the implementation is a configuration change, not a code fork.

Delivery ordering is not decided here: the gateway pack's position as the graph
root is owned by ADR-0005. See ADR-0005 for the authoritative statement of
gateway-first delivery order.

Gateway pack ref resolution — `gw.Ref` when set, otherwise `packs/<gw.Pack>` —
is centralised in the shared helper `config.GatewaySpec.PackRef()`, used
identically by `up`, `diff` and `upgrade`.

`cube-idp init` always derives `gateway.ref` from the finally selected gateway
pack, so a mismatched pack/ref pair can never be authored.

## Consequences

* Good, because pack authors target one portable routing API; an `HTTPRoute`
 written for a pack works under any conformant gateway implementation.
* Good, because the gateway implementation is a config line. `traefik` and
 `envoy-gateway` are both selectable and neither is privileged in code.
* Good, because one resolution helper means `up`, `diff`, `upgrade` and `doctor`
 cannot disagree about where the gateway pack comes from.
* Good, because deriving `gateway.ref` from the chosen pack at init time makes
 the incoherent-pair failure unrepresentable rather than merely documented.
* Bad, because Gateway API CRDs must be established before any HTTPRoute is
 applied, adding a mandatory CRD wait to the delivery path.
* Bad, because there is no Ingress escape hatch: an environment that can only
 offer Ingress cannot be served.
* Bad, because the `packs/<pack>` fallback only resolves when cube-idp runs from
 the root of a packs checkout — a documented v0.1.0 caveat, not a general path.
* Bad, because making Gateway API the routing surface forces the dependency
 graph to encode a special case rather than derive one: the gateway pack
 occupies a pinned position 0 and cannot declare `dependsOn`
 (`internal/pack/depgraph.go`). ADR-0005 owns that rule.

## Implementation Status

**This decision is implemented.** Confirmed against the code on 2026-07-20.

| Decision | Implemented at |
| --- | --- |
| Gateway API resources are the canonical routing surface: services are exposed through `HTTPRoute`, and any pack rendering a Gateway API object is wired to the gateway pack rather than to an Ingress controller. | `internal/up/up.go`; `internal/pack/depgraph.go` |
| The gateway pack vendors the pinned Gateway API standard-channel CRDs. | External to this repo (the gateway pack lives in `cube-idp/packs`); no code citation in this codebase |
| Traefik is the default gateway pack (ingress-nginx being end-of-life), and swapping the gateway implementation is a config line rather than a code fork. | `internal/config/types.go`; `cmd/init.go` |
| The gateway pack occupies pinned index 0 in the dependency graph and cannot declare `dependsOn`; any pack rendering a Gateway API object gains an implicit edge to it. Ordering itself is owned by ADR-0005. | `internal/pack/depgraph.go`; `internal/up/up.go` |
| Gateway pack ref resolution (`gw.Ref` when set, else `packs/<gw.Pack>`) lives in one shared helper used by `up`, `diff` and `upgrade` alike; the repo-relative fallback only resolves from inside a repo checkout. | `internal/config/types.go` |
| `cube-idp init` always derives `gateway.ref` from the finally selected gateway pack, so a mismatched pack/ref pair can never be authored. | `cmd/init.go` |

### Verification

- [ ] `internal/config/types.go` — `config.Default` sets `Gateway{Pack: "traefik", Ref: "oci://ghcr.io/cube-idp/packs/traefik:0.2.0"}`.
- [ ] `cmd/init.go` — `gatewayPacks` lists exactly `{traefik, envoy-gateway}`; no nginx option exists.
- [ ] `internal/config/types.go` — `GatewaySpec.PackRef()` returns `g.Ref` when non-empty, else `"packs/" + g.Pack`.
- [ ] `PackRef()` is the single resolution point: called from `internal/up/up.go`, `internal/diff/diff.go`, `internal/upgrade/plan.go` and `internal/doctor/doctor.go`.
- [ ] `internal/up/up.go` — `orderPackRefs` prepends the gateway ref and does nothing else.
- [ ] `cmd/init.go` — `gateway.Ref` is assigned after the wizard sets `gateway.Pack`, via `filepath.Join(localAbs, "packs", Pack)` in `--local` mode or `publishedGatewayRef(Pack)` (`cmd/init.go`) otherwise.
- [ ] Gateway API is on the delivery path: `internal/up/up.go` names `httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io` as the CRD every gateway pack must establish, and `up.go` waits for it before applying an HTTPRoute.
- [ ] `internal/pack/expose.go` (in `substitute`) — `strings.ReplaceAll(s, "${GATEWAY_PACK}", gw.Pack)`, so pack HTTPRoutes parent to the Gateway in the gateway pack's own namespace rather than a hardcoded `traefik`.
- [ ] No Ingress object is ever constructed or applied; the only occurrence of the string in Go source is a cluster-scoped-kind allowlist entry, `internal/cnoe/loader.go`.
- [ ] `internal/pack/depgraph.go` — `ResolveOrder` rejects `dependsOn` on `packs[0]`/`refs[0]` with `CodePackDepGateway`; `internal/pack/depgraph.go` sets `edges[i][0]` for any pack rendering an object in the Gateway API group.

Origin: mined from the archived planning corpus (`docs/archive/superpowers/`)
during the 2026-07-20 documentation audit; the underlying statements were
validated against the code before this record was written.

Member origins:

- `docs/archive/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-cube-idp-architecture-design.md:32` — Gateway API as the routing surface.
- `docs/archive/superpowers/research/2026-07-13-cube-idp-brainstorm/proposals.md:88` — Traefik as the default, swap-by-config.
- `docs/archive/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-cube-idp-pack-depends-and-cubelock-crd-design.md:165` — the gateway pack is delivered first unconditionally and cannot depend on other packs (see also DD6 at line 95 of the same document). ADR-0005 owns this rule.
- `docs/archive/superpowers/plans/2026-07-15-cube-idp-phase4-first-release.md:153` — single shared `PackRef()` helper (G13).
- `docs/archive/superpowers/plans/2026-07-15-cube-idp-phase4-first-release.md:1507` — the `packs/<pack>` fallback caveat consequence (F12).
- `docs/archive/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-cube-idp-phase5.md:2983-2985` — init's pack/ref coherence rule, published-mode twin of §5.7a.

One note on drift between the recorded statement and the code: the original
wording said `init` writes `gateway.ref` only in `--local` mode. It in fact
writes it in both modes (`cmd/init.go`); the substance — a mismatched
pack/ref pair cannot be authored — holds either way, and the Decision above
reflects the implemented behaviour.

No rationale for the specific `0.2.0` pin was recorded in the source material.
